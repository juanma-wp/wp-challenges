Task:

Create a block that fetches and displays posts from a specific category dynamically.

Requirements:

    Have a dropdown that shows categories on the side panel,

    Display fetched posts within the block (It can be only a linked title or more info if you want).

Starting Tips:

    Use ServerSideRender to render the posts,

    Use apiFetch to get categories for displaying in the side panel,

    Use the default REST API endpoints to fetch categories or create your own.
